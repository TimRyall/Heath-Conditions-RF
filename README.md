Using Random forests, Gradient Boositing and k-fold cross validation to predict Age Related Conditions based on a number of heath factors.
****

Context
----
They say age is just a number but a whole host of health issues come with aging. From heart disease and dementia to hearing loss and arthritis, aging is a risk factor for numerous diseases and complications. The growing field of bioinformatics includes research into interventions that can help slow and reverse biological aging and prevent major age-related ailments. Data science could have a role to play in developing new methods to solve problems with diverse data, even if the number of samples is small.

Data Set
----
The competition data comprises over fifty anonymized health characteristics linked to three age-related conditions. Your goal is to predict whether a subject has or has not been diagnosed with one of these conditions -- a binary classification problem.
